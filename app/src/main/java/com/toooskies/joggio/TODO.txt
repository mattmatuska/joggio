- Move Echonest JSON string literals into constants.
- Unit tests.
- Remove API constants from XML and into constants.  While it was good in theory, it's just too hard to use.
- Cache updates to GUI.
- Re-work the update-from-source-then-poll-updates SongInfoSource pattern.  Should just wait on download.
- Examine Echonest API for more efficient updates.
- Separate "lookup" objects from "internal data" objects.
- Add user input?
- Preserve data via restarts in some sort of data storage. SQLite? XML?
- Write custom Adapter to make display more than a single text string.
- Let user choose which song to select via Echonest.
- Better handling data updates-- such as, function on SongInfo for "isComplete", so we don't have to update it.

- Lesson 3 of android tutorial.

Long term:
- Take songs from Google Play/Amazon Music/Spotify playlists/libraries. (Multiple SongInfoSources.) May modify Echonest/other lookups.
- More Echonest data.
- Echonest jEN API.

Way down the road:
- Music playback.
- Adjustable speed.
- Work some C++ in there, just to show off.
